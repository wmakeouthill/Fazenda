## Project Overview
This is an Angular project for a Discord farm community with League of Legends inhouse queue statistics. The project should maintain a farm/agricultural theme combined with League of Legends aesthetics.

## Key Guidelines
- Use only TypeScript and CSS (no external CSS frameworks)
- Modern Angular patterns with standalone components
- Farm-themed styling with LoL game elements
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Mock data structure should be easily replaceable with real backend data
- Component-based architecture for reusability

## Theme Requirements
- Color scheme should incorporate farm colors (greens, browns, yellows) with LoL champion/ability themes
- Use agricultural icons and terminology where appropriate
- Maintain gaming aesthetic for statistics and competitive elements
- Typography should be clean and readable for data display

## Data Structure
- Player statistics (wins, losses, KDA, main champions, etc.)
- Match history with detailed game data
- Ranking system for the inhouse queue
- Champion performance statistics per player
